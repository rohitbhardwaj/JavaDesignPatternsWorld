Prototype Design Pattern
Definition:
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to create a clone of itself. This pattern is useful when creating new objects is costly (e.g., involves many computations or database operations) and similar objects need to be created frequently.

Use Case:
Cloning objects to avoid costly object creation.

Benefits of Prototype Pattern
Efficiency:

Reduces the cost of object creation by cloning instead of recreating from scratch.
Flexibility:

Simplifies the creation of objects with complex initialization logic.
Customizability:

Allows modifying cloned objects without affecting the original.
Challenges
Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy:
A shallow copy duplicates only references, while a deep copy duplicates the actual objects referenced, which can be more complex to implement.

Key Takeaways
Use Prototype Pattern when cloning objects is more efficient than recreating them.
Use Object Pool Pattern to manage reusable resources efficiently, especially in scenarios with limited resources like database connections.
