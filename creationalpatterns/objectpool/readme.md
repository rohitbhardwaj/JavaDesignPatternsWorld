Object Pool Design Pattern
Definition:
The Object Pool Pattern is a creational design pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects. It improves performance by reusing objects instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly.

Implementation of Object Pool Pattern
Use Case:
Efficiently manage database connections using an object pool.



Output
plaintext
Copy code
Executing query: SELECT * FROM users
Executing query: SELECT * FROM orders
No available connections.
Executing query: SELECT * FROM products



Benefits of Object Pool Pattern
Performance Improvement:

Reusing objects reduces the overhead of object creation and garbage collection.
Resource Management:

Useful for managing limited resources like database connections or threads.
Thread-Safety:

Synchronization ensures thread-safe access to the pool.
Challenges
Complexity:

Managing the lifecycle of pooled objects and ensuring they are returned properly can be tricky.
Deadlock Risks:

Improper handling of resources can lead to deadlocks or resource starvation.


Key Takeaways
Use Prototype Pattern when cloning objects is more efficient than recreating them.
Use Object Pool Pattern to manage reusable resources efficiently, especially in scenarios with limited resources like database connections.
