### **Whatâ€™s Inside?**

#### **1. SOLID Principles**  
Learn the fundamental principles of object-oriented design, with examples and scenarios demonstrating:  
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Keeping classes focused and maintainable.  
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Designing for extension, not modification.  
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Ensuring subtype substitutability.  
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Keeping interfaces lean and specific.  
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Decoupling high- and low-level modules using abstractions.  

#### **2. Creational Design Patterns**  
Understand object creation techniques to promote flexibility and reuse, including:  
- **Singleton**  
- **Builder**  
- **Factory Method**  
- **Abstract Factory**  
- **Prototype**  

#### **3. Structural Design Patterns**  
Discover patterns that focus on composing objects to create flexible structures:  
- **Adapter**  
- **Bridge**  
- **Composite**  
- **Decorator**  
- **Facade**  
- **Flyweight**  
- **Proxy**  

#### **4. Behavioral Design Patterns**  
Explore patterns that define object interaction and responsibility:  
- **Chain of Responsibility**  
- **Command**  
- **Interpreter**  
- **Iterator**  
- **Mediator**  
- **Memento**  
- **Observer**  
- **State**  
- **Strategy**  
- **Template Method**  
- **Visitor**
